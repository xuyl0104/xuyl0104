    Built a full-stack conversational AI system integrating LLM, prompt engineering, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), vector search, database, JWT user session control, and cloud persistence.
    Tech Stack: React + TypeScript, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, FAISS, AWS S3, Docker + Nginx.
    Gained hands-on experience with full-stack data pipelines, API integrations, and scalable deployments.

- Blockchain Ponzi Scheme Detection (https://github.com/xuyl0104/blockchain_ponzi_detection)
    Scraped and processed large-scale Ethereum transaction data, applying anomaly detection and feature engineering to identify fraudulent contracts.
    Tech Stack: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, MongoDB.
    Practical experience in data scraping, ingestion, and analysis, which translates directly to building data infrastructure for music intelligence.

- Industry Software Development Experience (https://github.com/xuyl0104/React-Framework)
    Delivered large-scale UI frameworks in React and backend services in Java/Spring Boot during my role at a multinational company.
    Strengthened my foundation in distributed systems, database design, and production-grade applications.


### üë®‚Äçüíª Experience
- 2019.08 -- Now: Teaching Assistant, Binghamton University

    I have been working as a TA at Binghamton University for the past five years.

    My job is to 1) help students with their questions on the algorithms and theories in the class, and 2) give topic-related lectures to provide more cutting-edge information about the courses.

    Courses: Machine Learning (course capacity: 45), Object-Oriented Programming & Data Structure (course capacity: 70), Algorithm Design & Analysis (course capacity: 42), Computer Architecture (course capacity: 40)

- 2017.06 - 2018.06: Software Engineer, Inspur 
  
    I developed a UI framework with React. This UI library includes built-in labels, buttons, cards, tables, inputs, modals, notifications, and more elements in various styles. 

    The UI framework is hosted on NPM and surely boosts your development efficiency.
